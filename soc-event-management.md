# Event Management

The Event Management page allows Admin users to create new storm events, edit Event details, create Phases, Activities for Depots during an event, as well as view Event Logs and Reports for each Event.

**Event Statuses**

| New | Not activated |
| Archived | Only viewable after archived |
| Active | Only one active event at a time |

## Event Creation

When a snow storm is approaching, to plan the event before it occurs (there are no restrictions in the system – 48 hours ahead should suffice), an Admin user can create a new storm event on the Event Management page by following the steps below:

  * Click the orange 'Create New Storm Event' button seen in the screenshot above. 
  * Enter values in all data fields in the prompt for 'New Event.' Click 'Create.'

![Event Creation](/images/soc/soc-event-management/event-creation.png){: .width-sm}{: data-lightbox="2"}

**Note:** Because the newly created Event isn't Active yet, it can be edited or deleted. Once the Event is Active, these are no longer an option. 

<section id="Event-Activation" markdown="1">

## Event Activation

Once the creation of Phases and Assignments is completed, the next step is to activate the Event, by following the steps below:

* Navigate back to the Event Management page.
* Click 'Activate' as seen below. Click 'Activate' on the prompt.  

  ![Event Activation](/images/soc/soc-event-management/event-activation.png){: .width-xl}{: data-lightbox="11"}

* This step will activate the initial 'Monitoring' Phase in all of the depots. Now that the Event is Active, the next step is to click 'Phases,' which opens the Phase Management page. 


* On the Phase Management page, click 'Activate/Resume Phase' (play button icon), as shown below, to activate the other phase to move forward from the initial 'Monitoring Phase.'

  **Typically, it will be the Depot Supervisor's duty to move the phases forward during an Event. Once one Phase is completed, all Supervisors are notified in the Supervisor App (SA) on the iPad the phase is completed.**

  **Only one active event can occur at a time, therefore if the play buttons are grayed out, that means another Event is already Active.**

* If another Phase is Active at the time of activation, like the initial 'Monitoring' Phase in this case (status 'Active' in the screenshot above), a prompt will be shown to either complete the current active phase or pause it. Click 'Complete Active.' The Monitoring Phase must always be manually completed. 

* Pausing an Active Phase allows to retain the states of all assignments, including breadcrumbs. If the Phase is resumed, all assignments will resume from their previous state. Pausing an Active Phase is used in case something occurred during a snow event that required moving to the next phase quickly but still needing to go back to it. 

* This completes the Event Activation. This means the Supervisor can begin monitoring the Event and Drivers can begin accepting Assignments. 


<section id="Event-Archivation" markdown="1">

## Event Archivation

Once the Event has been completed to the Admin's specifications, the Event can be closed out by clicking the 'Archive' button, as shown below. Archiving officially closes the Event in the system and allows activation of another event. 

If there are active assignments, the system will prompt with a warning as shown below. If the user clicks 'Archive' on this prompt, the system, in addition to closing out the Event, will close out and mark as 'completed' all outstanding phases and assignments that were still in progress.

<section id="Phase-Management" markdown="1">

## Phase Management

Phases are used during a storm Event to define specific Activities that allow planning of Assignments for Rosources. Once a new Event is created, the Admin user can create and manage Phases.

![Phase Creation](/images/soc/soc-event-management/phase-creation.png){: .width-xl}{: data-lightbox="4"}

**Note:** 'Monitoring' Phase for each depot created automatically with event. 

**Phase Statuses:**

| New | Newly created not activated Phase. |
| Active | Manually activated Phase (event can have several active phases at the time). |
| Completed | Manually complited by Supervisor user. |
| Archived | Status after event archivation. |

### Phase Creation

![Phase Creation3](/images/soc/soc-event-management/phase-creation3.png){: .width-md}{: data-lightbox="7"}

  * Enter values in all data fields in the prompt for 'New Phase.' Click 'Next.' See below on specific fields.
    * Activity: the dropdown specifies the types of activities that should occur within this Phase. An example of a Phase would be 'Plowing' - a Phase with an Activity set to 'Plowing' would prompt all Assignments and Drivers included in this phase to plow the routes.


 **Plan:** The dropdown currently includes two static plans with no ability to create others. A plan specifies to the system the types of roads to highlight on the route map and provides the ability to create assignments on the routes.

* Plan I - Salting
  * Step 1: Emergency+Primary
  * Step 2: Secondary
* Plan II - Plowing
   * Step 1: Emergency
    * Step 2: Primary+Secondary 

**Start Date and Completion Date:** Phases cannot overlap, so select the date and time of the new phase so it doesn't overlap with an already existing Phase (in this case, it would be the Monitoring Phase, but there can be more than just one existing Phase). Completion Date is an estimate in the system.
  * This will navigate back to Phase Management page, where the newly created Phase is listed with the status 'New.' The following Phase management options are available: edit the Phase details (pencil icon), edit driver assignments (snow plow icon), activate the phase (play icon), and delete a phase (X icon).

### Phase Activation

Once the creation of Phases and Assignments is completed, the next step is to activate the Event, by following the steps below:

* Navigate back to the Event Management page.
* Click 'Activate' as seen below. Click 'Activate' on the prompt.  

  ![Event Activation](/images/soc/soc-event-management/event-activation.png){: .width-xl}{: data-lightbox="11"}

## Assignments Planning

  * On the next prompt 'Edit Driver Assignments,' click 'Add' to assign a specific Route to Drivers attached to the Depot. Routes are pre-populated based on the selected Depot from the previous step. Select multiple Drivers where appropriate.
    * If a Route Assignment may require several passes of the same activity, then check the 'Multi-Pass' box. Routes can be filtered by Emergency or Residential.

    ![Edit Driver Assignments](/images/soc/soc-event-management/edit-driver-assignments.png){: .width-xl}{: data-lightbox="8"}

  * Once all Assignments are added, click 'Save Phase' to create the Phase in the Phase Management table.

<section id="Commit-Routes" markdown="1">

## Commit Routes

During phase activation process, Supervisors are able to make a decision which routes they would like to commit for work (such routes become committed). Once the phase is active, supervisors/inspectors are able to commit more routes for work or choose to commit all non-committed routes within the phase for work as event progresses.
